# IoT-Challenge
Project done for IoT Class using TinyOS on emulated sensors of type MICAz, The network is simulated using TOSSIM framework.
This project consists of two sensors communicating each other. The first sensor starts immediately, it starts a timer which expires every one second. When it is fired, the sensor sends a REQ message to node 2, requires an ACK for that message and waits for a response. When it gets N responses (set to 6), it stops the timer and the communication is closed.
On the other hand, the second sensor waits 3 second and activates. When it receives one REQ message from the sensor 1, it responds with an ACK, then reads one value (generated randomly) and sends it back to sensor 1, asking for an ACK.
In the Simulation.txt file, you can see that before the 3rd second, every REQ message sent by the sensor 1 is not ACKnowledged by sensor 2, because sensor 2 has not been activated yet. After the 3rd second, sensor 2 begins to receive the REQ messages sent my sensor 1 and it responds back first with the ACKs, then with the RESP messages. This goes until sensor 1 receives all the N responses it needs.
